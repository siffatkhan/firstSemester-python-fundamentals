First Semester - Python Fundamentals 🚀
This repository contains all my Python assignments, exercises, and solved questions from Tony Gaddis' book during my first semester of programming fundamentals. Since I originally switched from medical to computer science, this was my first exposure to programming, and everything was completely new to me at the time.

📌 What's Inside?
Solutions to Tony Gaddis exercises
First-semester programming assignments
Practice programs & experiments
Concepts I learned along the way
⚠️ Note:
Some of the code may contain errors or inefficiencies, as I was still learning the fundamentals.
The solutions reflect my early understanding of programming, so some parts might not be optimized.
Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or even refactor the code! 🚀
